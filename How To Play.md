# what is nomic

Nomic is a game in which changing the rules is a move. In that respect it differs from almost every other game. The primary activity of Nomic is proposing changes in the rules, debating the wisdom of changing them in that way, voting on the changes, deciding what can and cannot be done afterwards, and doing it. Even this core of the game, of course, can be changed.

# how to play

All you need is a github account. All rules will always be recorded in the [README.md] and all scores will be recorded in the [Scoreboard.md].
